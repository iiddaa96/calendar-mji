# Calendar tool in Javascript.

Site: (https://calendar-todo-js-mji-7fd4.vercel.app/)

## Installation

The school project is pre-configured with scripts in the `package.json` file so that you can easily run, start and test the project, this is done with `npm run <script-name>`.

Below is a list of the different scripts that can be run in the terminal:

- `npm install` - Installs all NodeJS modules (run once).
- `npm run update` - Updates the tests, needs to be run if the teacher has changed them.
- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server and opens the project in Chrome.
- `npm test` - Starts the development server and Cypress so you can work with the requirements list.
- `npm test -- --run` - Runs all the tests once in the terminal.


> If you get the error `Cypress verification timed out`, you can extend the verification time - [läs mer här](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63667880/cypress-verification-timed-out-after-30000-milliseconds).
